# search_metrics_demo
An excel file used to demo search metrics like DCG, MAP, nDCG, etc
This demo goes with my medium post https://medium.com/@jamesrubinstein/measuring-search-metrics-matter-de124c2f6f8c?sk=799a83013718d54c2591256c69263ff6
To use the demo, put a score from 0-3 in each block of the "relevance (graded)" column, it's the one that's peach and says "inputs go in this column" at the bottom :) 
Relevance (binary) values are calculated from the graded relevance column, scores of 0,1 are irrelevant and scores of 2,3 are relevant. You can change that by editing the formula, naturally 
if you have any questions reach out to me on medium, linkedin, or whatever
